Each file ends with "EOF".
Types:
	0 >> Normal branch mine type. This is created by the program.
	1 >> Spiral branch mine type. This is created by the program.
	2 >> Custom branch mine type. This is defined by the user in the file.
YLayers:
	0-8 >> How many branch set layers will there be?
Branch offset:
	0-Spacing >> How will the branches at different y-layers be offsetted from each other?
Type 1 specfic:
	Fibonacci setting: Uses a fibonacci spiral branch mining technique.
	Tunnel spacing: How far apart are the spacings (this will probably be 2)?
